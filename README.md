### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Angular CLI (v19 or higher)
- Basic knowledge of Angular and TypeScript

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project
cd angular-unit-testing-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
ng serve

# Open browser to http://localhost:4200
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
ng test

# Run tests with coverage report
ng test --code-coverage
